Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Share your feedback via [Vega Protocol public feedback discussions](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/feedback/discussions). 

The roadmap repository is for communicating the Vega Protocol roadmap. If you have feedback about this roadmap repository itself, such as how the issues are presented, let us know through the [General feedback discussions](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/feedback/discussions/new?category=General-Feedback&title=[Vega%20roadmap]%20).

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **feedback area** that indicates the area of the product to which the item belongs. For a list of current product areas, see below.

- Once a feature is ready, the **ready** label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed with a comment linking to the relevant software version changelog. Items that are ready will be deployed to testnet with the respective version. 

- Once a feature is stable in testnet the software will be made available for the validators. The validators will have a governance vote to deploy the software; once deployed the **shipped** label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed with a comment linking to the relevant software version release notes.
