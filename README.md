The Vega engineering roadmap is where you can learn about what features are being worked on, what stage they're in, and when we expect then to be ready for validators to choose to deploy. Got any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Share your feedback via [Vega Protocol feedback discussions](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/feedback/discussions). 

The roadmap repository is for communicating the Vega Protocol engineering roadmap. If you have feedback about this roadmap repository itself, such as how the issues are presented, let us know through the [General feedback discussions](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/feedback/discussions/new?category=General-Feedback&title=[Vega%20roadmap]%20).

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **function area** that indicates the function of the Vega software to which the item belongs. For a list of current function areas, see below.

- Once a feature is ready, the `ready` label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed with a comment linking to the relevant software version changelog. Items that are ready will be deployed to testnet with the respective version. 

- Once a tagged release is stable in testnet the software will be made available to the validators. The validators will have a governance vote to deploy the software; once deployed the `shipped` label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed with a comment linking to the relevant software version release notes.
